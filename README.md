## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


It's time to take another look at mobile development with Xamarin. 

Recently, Microsoft made the big announcement that it would purchase Xamarin. So what does that mean for us developers? It means that we now get all the great features and functionality of Xamarin included in Microsoft Visual Studio for free. 

You can even use Visual Studio Community Edition to do the development. And that is exactly what you'll learn in this course from Envato Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen. You'll learn how to get set up to create Xamarin iOS apps and you'll be able to follow along as Derek creates a simple iPhone calculator app using Xamarin and Visual Studio.
